# Lab 1: Frequency Analysis and Probability

This lab focuses on fundamental concepts of data analysis using the Titanic dataset.

## Key Analyses Performed:

1.  **Frequency Distribution:**
    *   Calculated the absolute, relative, and cumulative frequencies for the passenger classes (`class` column).

2.  **Contingency Table and Probability:**
    *   Created a two-way contingency table to analyze the relationship between `sex` and `survived`.
    *   Calculated various probabilities based on the contingency table:
        *   Joint Probability (e.g., P(Sex = female and Survived = 1))
        *   Marginal Probability (e.g., P(Sex = female))
        *   Conditional Probability (e.g., P(Survived = 1 | Sex = female))

3.  **Correlation Analysis:**
    *   Investigated the correlation between `age` and `fare`.
    *   Handled missing values in the `age` column by filling them with the median.
    *   Visualized the correlation using a heatmap and a scatter plot.

4.  **Bonus: Survival by Class:**
    *   Visualized the survival rates for different passenger classes using a stacked bar chart.
